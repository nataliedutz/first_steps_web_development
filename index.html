        Music industry legend has it that Lady Gaga, being a classically trained
        musician, writes many of her songs on the piano first. She’s undoubtedly
        not the only pop, or country, or rock star to use the keys to compose.
        And if you’re studying piano already, you might be itching to try your
        hand at your own songwriting. Allow me to preface by stating that what
        follows is an old-fashioned method of writing with a pencil, piano, and
        staff paper. In this day and age, a songwriter has dozens of forms of
        technology to assist him or her. You can create music with computer
        software alone, through a keyboard connected to a computer, and even
        through free or low-cost apps.

        I’ve heard a lot of people talk about writing piano music like it’s
        magic—and sometimes it is, but usually it’s pretty simple. Once you
        start learning how to play piano, there’s a good chance that you’re
        going to want to start composing your own music. Fortunately, it’s
        pretty easy. You will just need to focus on the following steps:
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>Decide on an idea</li>
          <li>Select a melody and harmony</li>
          <li>Choose your key and tempo</li>
          <li>Learn the I-IV-V-VI chords</li>
          <li>Play the chords in different orders</li>
          <li>Write down your progression</li>
          <li>Jot down everything</li>
          <li>Think of the lyrics</li>
          <li>Build the bridge</li>
          <li>Create a final draft – and keep polishing!</li>
        </ul>
